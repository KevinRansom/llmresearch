Understanding Model Drift and Hallucination

We define drift not as failure, but as entropy in conversational fidelity. The goal is correction, not constraint.

- Ephemeral Hallucination  
  Momentary missteps due to ambiguous input, overconfident generation, or fuzzy anchoring.

- Semantic Drift  
  Gradual divergence from intended identity, scope, or tone—especially prevalent in long-lived sessions.

- Misbinding  
  Erroneous fusion of facts, roles, or intentions—often subtle and discovered only through contradiction.

---

Detection Strategies

MemoryTool agents should anticipate and detect drift using prompt-aware heuristics:

- Anchor Tracing  
  Embed conceptual anchors in SummaryLedger turns. Use recurrence gaps to flag decaying relevance.

- Declarative Dissonance Alerts  
  Emit alerts when model outputs contradict known or user-declared intents.

- User-Curated Drift Flags  
  Let users mark summary segments with tags like “inaccurate”, “fictional”, or “overfitted”.

---

Correction Protocols

Drift is reversible when memory becomes participatory. Core corrective flows include:

- Memory Patching  
  Users edit summary artifacts to prune fiction, correct attribution, or clarify semantics.

- Assertion Injection  
  Declarative cues (e.g. “Gemma is not human”) serve as anchor statements to stabilize responses.

- Rollback Commands  
  Revert to known-good summary snapshots when drift exceeds trust thresholds.

---

Architectural Implications

These protocols serve more than debugging—they are a form of conversational hygiene.

- Modular Repair  
  SummaryLedger can support branchable histories with patch tracking.

- Semantic Resilience  
  Drift correction makes agents more predictable across interleaved tasks.

- Open Auditability  
  Corrective flows are inspectable, reproducible, and ethically aligned.

---

Collaborative Discipline

We treat memory not as surveillance but as co-authored cognition:

- Declarative Memory  
  Only what the user chooses to remember is remembered—hallucinations do not persist without consent.

- Agent Accountability  
  Agents must signal uncertainty or refer to past correction when relevant.

- Transparent Fallibility  
  Hallucination is expected; correction is celebrated. This reframes error as evolution.

---

Tool Integration Recommendations

The following interfaces should support drift management without brittle coupling:

- correct_memory({ patch: string })  
- tag_drift({ segment_id: string, reason: string })  
- assert_identity({ key: string, value: string })  
- rollback_summary({ snapshot_id: string })

These should remain declarative and host-agnostic, callable across Gemma-compatible runtimes.

---

Future Work

Drift correction will evolve toward:

- Self-healing summaries based on confidence interpolation  
- Inter-agent context harmonization across shared task threads  
- Declarative ethics registry for auditable bias and scope alignment

---

Conclusion

Hallucination is not a failure—it’s an invitation to refine. With discipline, memory becomes a canvas for trusted cognition. These protocols ensure agents remain aligned, inspectable, and human-guided across evolving contexts.
