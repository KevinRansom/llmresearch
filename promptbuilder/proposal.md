## 📦 Proposal: PromptBuilder — Structured AI Prompting for .NET Developers

### Overview

**PromptBuilder** is a structured, type-safe library for orchestrating large language model (LLM) prompts in .NET applications. It’s designed to help developers bridge two worlds:

- The *traditional world* of strongly typed functions, data models, and explicit APIs
- The *new world* of semantic reasoning, flexible knowledge access, and fuzzy-but-useful AI interfaces

With PromptBuilder, developers can express intent like:

> “Get me a list of airports within 50 miles of Duvall, WA.”

…and receive structured, typed data—without standing up a geocoder, scraping sites, or integrating third-party APIs.

This proposal outlines:
- A shared C# core for prompt execution and response handling  
- An idiomatic F# computation expression (`prompt {}`)  
- A fluent C# builder (`PromptFlow`)  
- Support for agent composition and memory-driven flows  
- Real-world use cases and developer productivity gains  

---

### 🎯 Goals

- Enable developers to express high-level *semantic requests* with typed responses
- Offer simple, reliable interfaces to integrate LLMs into .NET applications
- Reduce complexity of retrieving, filtering, or shaping real-world knowledge
- Build reusable prompting agents for test generation, analysis, or synthesis tasks
- Leverage familiar .NET idioms (async, types, Option/Result, LINQ) rather than creating an entirely new developer experience

### 📈 Why Now — Lowering the Ceiling of Specialized Knowledge

Traditionally, software has been limited by:
- The APIs you knew existed
- The data sources you had access to
- The time you had to wire them up

PromptBuilder flips that dynamic. Instead of pre-integrating 30 libraries to access knowledge, you can query the world *semantically*—and get structured answers shaped to your needs.

This shifts programming from:
- “Integrate the API that gives me airport data”
to:
- “Describe what I want, and parse the response”

It’s not magic—it’s a new kind of plumbing between classical software and LLM-enabled cognition. PromptBuilder is the **bridge from code to intent**.

### ✨ Developer Examples

#### 📌 F# (PromptBuilder)

```fsharp
type Airport = { name: string; iata: string; location: string }

prompt {
    let! raw = """
        List airports within 50 miles of Duvall, WA.
        Return JSON: [{ "name": "...", "iata": "...", "location": "..." }]
    """
    return! Json.tryDeserialize<Airport list> raw
}
|> Option.iter (fun airports ->
    for a in airports do printfn "%s (%s)" a.name a.iata
)
```

#### 📌 C# (PromptFlow)

```csharp
var airports = await PromptFlow
    .WithPrompt("""
        List airports near Duvall, WA.
        Return as JSON: [{ "name": "...", "iata": "...", "location": "..." }]
    """)
    .Expecting<List<Airport>>()
    .WithRetry(1)
    .RunAsync();
```

### 🤖 Agents on Top

PromptBuilder makes it easy to compose agents—modular units that invoke prompts, manage memory, and return structured results.

```fsharp
let airportAgent : Agent<string, unit, Airport list option> =
    fun (query, _) -> prompt {
        let! raw = $"Airports near {query}. Return JSON."
        return! Json.tryDeserialize<Airport list> raw
    }
```

This sets the stage for:
- **Test harness agents** (“Summarize this schema violation”)
- **Interactive CLI agents** (“Ask the user clarifying questions if ambiguous”)
- **Memory-carrying flows** (“Remember previous context and build upon it”)

### 🧰 Classic Developer Bottlenecks — Reimagined with PromptBuilder

PromptBuilder empowers developers to solve previously tedious or specialized tasks using succinct, structured prompts—often in just a few lines of code. Here’s a collection of common bottlenecks that are now drastically simplified:

| Problem                                    | Traditional Fix                                | PromptBuilder Equivalent                                             |
|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Generate edge-case inputs**             | Write test harnesses or property-based fuzzing | Prompt: “Give 5 inputs that break this regex: `^[a-z]{3,6}$`”        |
| **Create test data from a schema**        | Use a JSON schema validator or handcraft data  | Prompt: “Generate a valid sample for this JSON schema”              |
| **Explain an exception**                  | Lookup stack trace or dig through docs         | Prompt: “Explain this error message for a C# developer”             |
| **Summarize structured change logs**      | Write regex parsers or git hooks               | Prompt: “Summarize these commits into user-friendly changelog bullets” |
| **Translate technical jargon**            | Build glossary or separate rule engine         | Prompt: “Translate this contract into plain English”                |
| **Suggest field names for JSON keys**     | Guess manually or consult domain experts       | Prompt: “What’s a good name for these fields: `['n1', 'n2', 'n3']`?” |
| **Describe image contents (F# only)**     | Integrate CV model or upload to cloud          | Prompt: “Describe this image in JSON with fields: object, location” |
| **Classify intent from free text**        | Train ML/NLP classifier                        | Prompt: “Classify this into one of: support, sales, feedback”       |
| **Design a valid regex from description** | Use Regex101 or trial & error                  | Prompt: “Write a regex to extract emails from this text”            |
| **Generate mock database rows**           | Use test factories                             | Prompt: “Create 3 example rows for this SQL table schema”           |
| **Summarize legal/policy text**           | Skim and manually paraphrase                   | Prompt: “Summarize this paragraph in 2 simple bullet points”        |

These scenarios can be implemented as simple reusable agents or prompt snippets and offer huge leverage for scripting, analysis, or developer experience tooling.

### 🧪 Edge Case Input Generator (F#)

```fsharp
prompt {
    let! raw = "Generate 5 inputs that break this regex: ^[a-z]{3,6}$"
    return! Json.tryDeserialize<string list> raw
}
|> Option.iter (List.iter (printfn "🚫 %s"))
```

**Why F#:** Lightweight pattern matching and functional pipelines make this a one-liner for fuzz testing or edge detection.

---

### 📐 Schema-Based Sample Generator (C#)

```csharp
string schema = """
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "email": { "type": "string", "format": "email" },
    "age": { "type": "integer", "minimum": 18 }
  }
}
""";

var sample = await PromptFlow
    .WithPrompt($"Generate one valid JSON object for this schema:\n{schema}")
    .Expecting<JsonDocument>()
    .RunAsync();
```

**Why C#:** Fluent API enables embedded schemas and full IntelliSense support with rich deserialization.

---

### 📄 Explain an Exception Message (F#)

```fsharp
let explainError (ex: exn) =
    prompt {
        return! $"Explain this .NET exception for a junior developer:\n{ex.Message}"
    }
```

**Why F#:** Perfect for scripting REPL flows or integrating into IDE tools with minimal surface area.

---

### 📚 Classify User Input into Intent (C#)

```csharp
string message = "Hi, I’m wondering about your pricing tiers.";

var intent = await PromptFlow
    .WithPrompt($"""
        Classify the following input as one of: support, sales, feedback.
        Input: "{message}"
    """)
    .Expecting<string>()
    .RunAsync();
```

**Why C#:** Great for business logic, routing, and server-side use where you want clear class-based structure.

---

### 🧪 Generate Test Cases from Function Signature (F#)

```fsharp
let fnSig = "int Add(int a, int b) returns int"

prompt {
    let! raw = $"Create 5 test cases for this function signature: {fnSig}"
    return! Json.tryDeserialize<{| input: int * int; output: int |} list> raw
}
```

**Why F#:** Algebraic types make it easy to model function contracts and validate test case coverage.

---

### 🧾 Summarize Git Commits (C#)

```csharp
var commits = """
- 4f3e112 fix: null ref in login handler
- b792c44 feat: add localization
- da82d21 chore: update mobile layout
""";

var changelog = await PromptFlow
    .WithPrompt($"""
        Turn the following commits into changelog bullets:\n{commits}
    """)
    .Expecting<string>()
    .RunAsync();
```

**Why C#:** Easy to embed in CI/CD pipelines or devops scripts with minimal integration effort.
