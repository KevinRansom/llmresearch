## 📦 Proposal: PromptBuilder — Structured AI Prompting for .NET Developers

### Overview

**PromptBuilder** is a structured, type-safe library for orchestrating large language model (LLM) prompts in .NET applications. It’s designed to help developers bridge two worlds:

- The *traditional world* of strongly typed functions, data models, and explicit APIs
- The *new world* of semantic reasoning, flexible knowledge access, and fuzzy-but-useful AI interfaces

With PromptBuilder, developers can express intent like:

> “Get me a list of airports within 50 miles of Duvall, WA.”

…and receive structured, typed data—without standing up a geocoder, scraping sites, or integrating third-party APIs.

This proposal outlines:
- A shared C# core for prompt execution and response handling  
- An idiomatic F# computation expression (`prompt {}`)  
- A fluent C# builder (`PromptFlow`)  
- Support for agent composition and memory-driven flows  
- Real-world use cases and developer productivity gains  

---

### 🎯 Goals

- Enable developers to express high-level *semantic requests* with typed responses
- Offer simple, reliable interfaces to integrate LLMs into .NET applications
- Reduce complexity of retrieving, filtering, or shaping real-world knowledge
- Build reusable prompting agents for test generation, analysis, or synthesis tasks
- Leverage familiar .NET idioms (async, types, Option/Result, LINQ) rather than creating an entirely new developer experience

### 📈 Why Now — Lowering the Ceiling of Specialized Knowledge

Traditionally, software has been limited by:
- The APIs you knew existed
- The data sources you had access to
- The time you had to wire them up

PromptBuilder flips that dynamic. Instead of pre-integrating 30 libraries to access knowledge, you can query the world *semantically*—and get structured answers shaped to your needs.

This shifts programming from:
- “Integrate the API that gives me airport data”
to:
- “Describe what I want, and parse the response”

It’s not magic—it’s a new kind of plumbing between classical software and LLM-enabled cognition. PromptBuilder is the **bridge from code to intent**.

### ✨ Developer Examples

#### 📌 F# (PromptBuilder)

```fsharp
type Airport = { name: string; iata: string; location: string }

prompt {
    let! raw = """
        List airports within 50 miles of Duvall, WA.
        Return JSON: [{ "name": "...", "iata": "...", "location": "..." }]
    """
    return! Json.tryDeserialize<Airport list> raw
}
|> Option.iter (fun airports ->
    for a in airports do printfn "%s (%s)" a.name a.iata
)
```

#### 📌 C# (PromptFlow)

```csharp
var airports = await PromptFlow
    .WithPrompt("""
        List airports near Duvall, WA.
        Return as JSON: [{ "name": "...", "iata": "...", "location": "..." }]
    """)
    .Expecting<List<Airport>>()
    .WithRetry(1)
    .RunAsync();
```

### 🤖 Agents on Top

PromptBuilder makes it easy to compose agents—modular units that invoke prompts, manage memory, and return structured results.

```fsharp
let airportAgent : Agent<string, unit, Airport list option> =
    fun (query, _) -> prompt {
        let! raw = $"Airports near {query}. Return JSON."
        return! Json.tryDeserialize<Airport list> raw
    }
```

This sets the stage for:
- **Test harness agents** (“Summarize this schema violation”)
- **Interactive CLI agents** (“Ask the user clarifying questions if ambiguous”)
- **Memory-carrying flows** (“Remember previous context and build upon it”)

### ✅ Summary

PromptBuilder makes AI feel like a natural extension of .NET—typed, composable, familiar. It’s not about reinventing how you code; it’s about freeing you from needing to know everything in advance.

Instead of asking developers to build tools to find facts, PromptBuilder lets them build tools that *ask for facts*, safely and fluently.

When knowledge becomes code—typed and testable—the ceiling of creativity rises. PromptBuilder helps developers get there.
