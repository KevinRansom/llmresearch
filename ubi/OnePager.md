**THE POST EMPLOYMENT TRANSITION MODEL**  
*Re-envisioning Human Purpose and Provisioning in the AI-Assisted Productivity Era*  

---

**PREMISE**  
Artificial intelligence and automation are dramatically increasing productivity, allowing society to produce more with fewer human workers. As this shift accelerates, we must reimagine the role of people in a future where *purpose, creativity, care, and civic life*—not just wage labor—are central to our shared flourishing.  
This proposal offers a practical, humane framework for transitioning away from employment as the primary gateway to economic security and social belonging.

**CORE PRINCIPLES**  
• *Provision Without Condition*  
All people deserve access to food, shelter, education, and healthcare—regardless of employment status.

• *Dignity Through Choice*  
Everyone should be free to pursue employment, retirement, learning, creativity, caregiving, or civic service—without coercion or stigma.

• *Collective Investment in Stability*  
As productivity rises, we must ensure the benefits are widely shared—through public investment, new income mechanisms, and community infrastructure that supports well-being and participation.

• *Health Without Preconditions*  
Every person deserves reliable access to comprehensive healthcare—not as a benefit of employment, income, or status, but as a basic condition of dignity and freedom.

**STRATEGIC PILLARS**  
1. **Lifelong Civic Education**  
Free access to education of all kinds—with a living stipend for full-time learners pursuing knowledge, craft, or retraining at any age.

2. **Phased, Voluntary Retirement**  
Optional retirement beginning at age 60, with eligibility expanding alongside national productivity. Benefits indexed to cost of living and access to time.

3. **Civic Work Dividend**  
Guaranteed public funding for nonprofit, care-focused, and community-rooted employment—for those who choose to serve beyond commercial markets.

4. **Purposeful Employment as a Civic Option**  
Fair, meaningful work in education, caregiving, health, and the arts remains available to those who wish to stay engaged. Employment is *honored—not required*—as a valid and valuable path.

**WHY THIS MATTERS**  
Technological change is inevitable. Human discard is not. With foresight and shared purpose, we can ensure that everyone has the opportunity to live with dignity—not *because* they’re needed for production, but *because* they are human.
