I’m developing a framework for generating RL training data for language models by simulating rich debugging sessions across real-world codebases. The goal isn’t to train models directly but to provide tools that produce structured episodes: symbolic context, agent actions like breakpoint placement or variable mutation, and rewards linked to runtime behavior. We’ve discussed using a cache-augmented generation (CAG) layer, a runtime-neutral debugger interface, and provenance ranking heuristics. Can you help me continue refining the proposal document? Also, let’s explore variable attribution signals and mutation strategies further.
