Absolutely! Here's a detailed and structured prompt you can feed directly into GitHub Copilot (or paste at the top of a file or comment block) to give it the full context of our "HKT-lite via attributes" approach in F#:

```fsharp
/// GOAL: Prototype a lightweight HKT-style abstraction in F#
///       using attributes and explicit modules—no SRTPs or kinded types.
///
/// DESIGN PHILOSOPHY:
/// - Avoid static member constraints (SRTPs) due to complexity and poor dev ergonomics
/// - Avoid typeclasses / full HKTs (F# lacks kind-polymorphism)
/// - Use attributes like [<Functor>] or [<Applicative>] to mark modules that implement known "laws"
/// - Structure reusable behavior as functions or records grouped in modules
/// - Use analyzers (or later, compiler extension) to validate conformity to expected signatures
///
/// EXAMPLE: A [<Functor>] module must define:
///     map : ('T -> 'U) -> F<'T> -> F<'U>
///
/// SCOPE:
/// ? Attribute-based declaration of abstract behaviors
/// ? Explicit module per instance (e.g., ListFunctor, OptionFunctor)
/// ? Shared usage API via passed-in modules or dictionaries
/// ?? No automatic resolution or inference (developer explicitly selects module)
/// ? No compiler inference of type constructors (* ? * kind)
///
/// GUIDING CODE STRUCTURE:
///
/// Attributes (declarative markers):
[<AttributeUsage(AttributeTargets.Module, AllowMultiple = false)>]
type FunctorAttribute() = inherit System.Attribute()

[<AttributeUsage(AttributeTargets.Module, AllowMultiple = false)>]
type ApplicativeAttribute() = inherit System.Attribute()

/// Sample instance module — conforms to [<Functor>]
[<Functor>]
module ListFunctor =
    let map f xs = List.map f xs

/// Usage site
let incrementList = ListFunctor.map ((+) 1)

/// Optional registry-style pattern (manual):
module Functors =
    let list = { new IFunctor<_> with member _.Map f xs = List.map f xs }

/// Interface (if needed) to wrap behavior
type IFunctor<'F> =
    abstract Map<'T,'U> : ('T -> 'U) -> 'F -> 'F

/// === OUT OF SCOPE ===
/// - Kind checking
/// - Automatic inference / resolution
/// - SRTP-based constraints
/// - Full-on category theory

/// TODOs for Copilot:
/// - Help scaffold functor modules for Option, Result, etc.
/// - Validate that `map` signatures match expected form
/// - Help wire up `map2` and Applicative-style abstractions
/// - Suggest ergonomic API for invoking and composing these behaviors
```

This context will help GitHub Copilot understand you're building a **modular, attribute-based approximation of HKTs** in F#, favoring **explicitness and tooling over type-level wizardry**. It’s enough structure to help it scaffold instance modules, suggest compatible signatures, and avoid offering SRTPs as a default.
