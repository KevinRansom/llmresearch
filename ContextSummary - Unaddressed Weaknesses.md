Outstanding Weaknesses to Address
Lossy Summarization Risks Recursive compression may erase critical low-signal details that become important later.

Semantic Drift & Conceptual Mutation Summary evolution across turns can subtly distort meaning unless anchored or periodically validated.

Lack of Granular Recall Without full transcript access, users and agents can’t drill down into specific past turns when precision matters.

User Burden in Editable Memory Reliance on manual editing and tagging may overwhelm or be ignored by typical users.

Unstructured Knowledge Representation Summaries struggle to encode structured facts (IDs, dates, relationships) necessary for high-fidelity reasoning.

No Runtime Feedback or Confidence Signals Absence of hallucination scoring or contradiction alerts limits error detection and drift correction.

Merge Conflict Resolution Ambiguity Protocols for recap merging lack clear heuristics or fallback behavior in case of semantic conflicts.

Limited Privacy Guarantees Contextual decay ? deletion; no primitives yet for purging, redacting, or auditing memory lifecycles.

No Simulation of UI-Based UX Without native menus or windows, the conversational interface may feel opaque or inconsistent to users without careful prompting.

Agent-Independence vs Functionality Tension Some desirable features (e.g., semantic scoring) presume model internals, challenging runner neutrality and tool portability.
